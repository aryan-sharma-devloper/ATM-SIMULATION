# ATM-SIMULATION
The `ATMGUI` Java program is a smart ATM simulator that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide users with a secure and interactive banking experience. Built using Java Swing, this application incorporates two levels of authentication—OTP (One-Time Password) and PIN verification—before granting access to standard ATM functionalities. Upon launching the program, an OTP is automatically generated and displayed to simulate the OTP sent to the user's registered mobile number. The user must correctly input this OTP, after which they are prompted to enter their personal ATM PIN. Only when both the OTP and PIN are validated successfully does the application enable the core banking features. These include checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, changing the PIN, printing account details, and exiting the system. The GUI is neatly structured using `BorderLayout` and `GridLayout` to divide the interface into distinct areas: a display area for instructions and output, a central input field for entering OTP or PIN, and a panel with six operational buttons aligned vertically. The system ensures input validation and handles incorrect entries gracefully by providing meaningful error messages. Internally, the program maintains key account details like the balance amount, PIN, account ID, and account holder's name, allowing each function to work seamlessly with accurate data. Although simple in its design, the simulator demonstrates important concepts like authentication flow, GUI event handling, user interaction, and encapsulated method logic. Overall, it provides a foundational model of a secure ATM interface and can be further expanded to include more advanced features like transaction history, user session management, persistent storage, or biometric authentication for enhanced realism and functionality.
